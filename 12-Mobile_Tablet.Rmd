## Compose a Musical Theme

Using free apps (like Synth), students create their version of a “theme song” for an academic concept (recidivism, electron shells, etc) and also justify WHY the composition includes the emotion or action it does.

## Create a digital (picture) book

Using the camera on their smartphone or tablet, the students take pictures of a topic. This could be areas or people that matter to them (if you use it as an ice-breaker activity) or any other topic. Using the [Book Creator](https://bookcreator.com/) app which can be used on the iPad as an app or online on their laptop or Android device, the create a short digital (picture) book with texts explaining what is shown in the pictures.
